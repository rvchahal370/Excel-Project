We can performe the data analysis through the Pivot table in excel.

Firstly, we have to open the excel and can click on the Pivot table under the insert.

Automatically it will select the whole data from the selected excel but if not then we can select it
through shift + ctrl + right arrow + down arrow

Thereafter new sheet will be created with the pivot table, where we can perform different analysis.

Finally, we will be having all the columns showing under the PivotTable Fields and we can use them under the 
Filters, Columns, Rows and Values field.

Filters: with the help of filters, we can filter the data according to the selected fields,
Example: choosing Gender and Age group field, we can filter the Revenue, profit, cost according to that fields.

Columns: we can use the column field to show the data in the different column range.
Example: Selecting Year in the column field, we can filter the Profit for each year respectively.

Rows: while using rows we can show the data in the different row range. we can show the expanded or collapsed row data as well.
Example: we can choosed Country and city under Rows to show the Revenue for the different countries correspondance to the cities as well.

Values: Under the value we can calculate the final value of the data.
Example: while choosing Profit column under the values, we can show the sum of the profit for each country and city.

=> we can add extra calculated field through the Fields, Items, & Sets column under the Anallyze option.
Under that field we can select any number of fields and set the formula for them.

Formulas in the excel:
MIN(Value): Calculating the minimum value among all selected one
MAX(Value): Calculating the maximum value among all selected one
IF(Value):  Using the if else condition. Example: IF(F1:F10 > 30, "OLD", "YOUNG")=> If the value of the selected columns is more than 30 then "OLD" will be printed other wise "YOUNG" will be printed.
IFS(Value): Used to show multiple outputs based on the multiple conditions:
            Example: IFS(F2:F10="Salesman", "DP3", F2:F10 = "HR", "DP4", F2:F10 = "Receptionist", "DP5", F2:F10 = "Regional Manager", "DP1")
            If the value of the selected column is "Salesman" then "DP3" will be printed.
            If the value of the selected column is "HR" then "DP4" will be printed.
            If the value of the selected column is "Receptionist" then "DP5" will be printed.
            If the value of the selected column is "Regional Manager" then "DP1" will be printed.

Len(Value):  Used to find the length of the particular column data. Example: Len(C1:C10).
             Can be used to see difference between 100s and thousands. Can find bad Social Security numbers if they're 10 digits instead of 9.

Left(Value): It is used like Substring, Fetcing the right part of character till the limit has been given.
             Example: Left(B1:B10,3) => It is providing the first three characters of the column.

Right(Value: It is used like Substring, Fetcing the right part of character till the limit has been given.
             Example: Right(B1:B10,3) => It is providing the last three characters of the column.

TEXT(Value): It is used to convert date format to text format.
             Example: TEXT(I4:I12, "dd/mm/yyyy") => It will convert date into the "dd/mm/yyyy" text format.

TRIM(Value): It is used to remove the unwanted space from the columns data.
             Example: TRIM(C1:C10) => It removes the unwanted space from left and right side of the "last name" column data.

CONCATENATE(Value): It is used to concatinate two strings or different columns data.
                    Example 1: CONCATENATE(B1:B10, " ", C2:C10) => it is used to concatenate first name and last name. the output will be first_name + Last_name
                    Example 2: CONCATENATE(B1:B10, ".", C2:C10, "@gmail.com") => output will be gmail id including first name and last name

SUBSTITUE(Value):   It is used to replace the value which is already there to the given value in the Substitute formula.
                    Example 1: SUBSTITUTE(I2:I10, "-", "/") => It will be usedfull if in the date field their are two different formats by mistake then we can change it to only correct format through the same formula.
                    Example 2: SUBSTITUTE(I2:I10, "/", "-") => It is used to replace the "/" symbol from all the data in the specific date column to "-" symbol
                    SUBSTITUTE with 1st instance: it is used to replace the vale only on the first instance of the text field.
                    Example: SUBSTITUE(I2:I10, "/", "-", 1) => It replace the "/" symbol to "-" only for the first match   
                    SUBSTITUTE with 2nd instance: it is used to replace the vale only on the second instance of the text field.
                    Example: SUBSTITUE(I2:I10, "/", "-", 2) => It replace the "/" symbol to "-" only for the second match 

SUM(Value):         It is used to total the values for the specific column.
                    Example: SUM(G2:G10) => It will add all the salaries and shows the final result.

SUMIF(Value):       It is used to total the values for the specific column based on the specific condition.
                    Example: SUMIF(G2:210, ">50000") => It will add all the salary column where salary is more than 50000
   
SUMIFS(Value):      It can be used to get the total with the multiple if conditions.
                    Example: SUMIFS(G2:G10,E2:E10,"Female",D2:D10,">29") => It will add the salary if Gender is female and age is greater than 29

COUNT(Value):       It is used to count the number of records/rows for the particular column.
                    Example: COUNT(G2:G10) => It will return the number of records/rows available for the salary column.

COUNTIF(Value):     It is used to return number of records with respect to the specific condition.
                    Example: COUNTIF(G2:G10, ">43000") => It returns the number of records from the salary column where salary is greater then 43000

COUNTIFS(Value):    Its returns the number of records for the particular column base on multiple IF conditions.
                    Example: COUNTIFS(A2:A10, ">1004", E2:E10, "Female") => It return the number of records available for the EmployeeId column where Id is greater than 1004 and Gender is Female

DAYS(Value):        It is used to return number of days base on the given start date and end date.
                    Example: DAYS(end_date, start_date) = DAYS(I2,H2) => It returns number of days available between end_date from I column and start date from H column

NETWORKDAYS(Value): It returns number of days available based on start date and end date excluding holidays and weekends.
                    Example: NETWORKDAYS(start_date, end_date) = NETWORKDAYS(H2,I2) Note: it is taking [Holiday] as its third column whicch will be having default holidays and weekend values.
